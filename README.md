# Styleguide template written in Vue

This is a template for a styleguide/pattern library/design system.  It is written using Vue.

Currently it is work in progress and acting as much as a way of me learning Vue as it is being useful as a styleguide.  Hopefully it'll be both.

## Build Setup

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
