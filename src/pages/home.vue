    <h1 class="header1">Welcome to our Styleguide</h1>
    <p>This styleguide contains the set of web components and patterns that are used on our website.</p>

    <p>As well as individual components it also contains descriptions and examples of how these components should be used and how they fit together.
      Ideally this should help to develop a consistent experience for users of the site as well as providing a central location where developers,
      content editors and designers can access an up to date library of UI components, brand guidelines, brand assets and code snippets.</p>

    <p>Also contained here are the slightly less tangible parts of the brand - tone of voice, principles and values etc.</p>
